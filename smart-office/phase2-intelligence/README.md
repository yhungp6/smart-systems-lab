#Phase  - Rule-Based Intelligence

## Overview
Phase 2 introduces **intelligence** into the Smart Office Control System.

Instead of relying solely on manual user input, the system now makes decisions automatically based on predefined rules. This phase simulates how smart environments respond to conditions without constant human control.

---

## Key Features
- Rule-based decision logic
- Automatic device behavior
- Separation of control logic from UI
- Simulated smart office responses

---

## How It Works
- Devices are represented as software models
- Rules define how devices react to conditions
- The Flask backend evaluates these rules
- The frontend displays system state and behavior

This design mirrors real-world control systems used in automation and robotics.

---

## Technologies
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Modular Python architecture

---

## Purpose of This Phase
This phase focuses on:
- Decision-making systems
- Intelligent automation concepts
- Preparing the foundation for future AI, robotics, and sensor-driven behavior

It intentionally avoids machine learning to emphasize **deterministic control logic**, which is critical in robotics and embedded systems.

---

## Next Steps
Future phases will expand this intelligence to:
- Real sensor input
- Robotics control
- 3D visualization and simulation
